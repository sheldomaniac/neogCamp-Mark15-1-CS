            <p class="summary-text"><em>On first glance, Counter-Strike seems to be all about the aim. So you may think improving your aim is everything. But is it?</em></p>
            
            <p><em>Counter-Strike:Global Offensive</em> is a first-person shooter game made by Valve. The objective of the game is simple : First team to reach 16 rounds wins.</p>
            
            <p>You have the choice of playing as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Terrorist</li>
                <li>Counter-Terrorist</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You win as a Terrorist player in two ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Kill all the Counter-Terrorists</li>
                <li>Explosion of the bomb</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You win as a Counter-Terrorist player in two ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Kill all the Terrorists</li>
                <li>Defuse the bomb</li>
                <li>Running out the timer and staying alive</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Below, I shall be providing you tips which may help you in the game as a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist player.</p>

        <h2>Map Knowledge</h2>
        <p>Map knowledge is one of the most important parts of this game. Map knowledge consists not only knowing the positions of all places, but also knowing the angles where a opponent may not be visible in plain sight.</p>
        <p>A team of five members cannot monitor all the viewing angles. So skillfully using the map knowledge to eliminate areas where Terrorists may not be present helps in making th combat easier.</p>
        <p>The greatest byproduct of map knowledge is relfected by the popular saying <em>"Clear all the angles".</em> </p>

            <h2>Money Management</h2>
            <p>Like in real life, money management is crucial in Counter-Strike and can end up determining the final outcome in critical situations. </p>
            <p>With the addition of loss bonus, sometimes it may be better to not buy in the current round so that you can fully buy grenades and equipments in the next round. If the loss bonus is high, you may take a gamble buy too with cheaper weapons in order to cause maximum damage or retrieve weapons from the opponents. Lack of funds may cause you to miss out on the extra grenade or defuse kit which may prove to be expensive in clutch situations.</p>

        <h2>Aim Practice</h2>
        <p>Last but not the least, aim practice is crucial.</p>
        <div class="mainImage"><img src="./blog-src/img/aimbotz.jpg" alt="aimbotz-pic"></div>
        <p>A shooter game is nothing without the having the skill to shoot. After all, the things mentioned above ay help you to be a good teammate, but when times are hard and you are backed in a corner, pure aim can be the only option to help you win a game.</p>
        <p>So how to improve your aim? Here are a few tips below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Fix your sensitivity.</h4>
                <p>This is a thing which most beginners get wrong all the time. There is no point of practicing your aim if you are not comfortable with your sensitivity. You want to minimize the luck factor in this game (especially aiming) so having a good sensitivity means you are in control of your game as much as possible.</p>
                <p>The most common way to adjust your sensitivity is try snap aiming between two points and then increasing/ reducing your sensitivity until it reaches an optimum value. This is a <a>great tutorial</a> for you to get started.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Download community workshop maps.</h4>
                
                <p>Plenty of aim maps are available on steam workshop which use bots as a target. One such popular map is called 'Aimbotz' by uLLeTiCaL. This helps you in your snap aim and the overall positioning of your crosshair. Most workshops also have recoil training so you can improve your spray control. However, keep in minds that these are bots and not real players, so to improve more....  </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Play lots of deathmatch as warm-up.</h4>
                <p>Playing death match as warmup not only helps you in polishing your aim and reflexes, it also allows you to test various weapons which you may have to use in unfavorable situations. Community servers are preferred over in-game servers as the skill levels are higher. Do not fret if you get spwan-killed frequently. Just stay strong and keep practicing until you get better. Deathmatch servers also help you simulate recoil in clutch situations while helps immensely in competititve matches.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Learn from the pros.</h4>
